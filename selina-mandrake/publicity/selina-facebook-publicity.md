"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" [crossovered with DS9, Tanakh, Israelism, The Three Musketeers, and more]
No warnings.
Selina Mandrake (Emma Watson) was a geeky Anglo-American girl in her high school senior year in 2011 California, who thought that the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer was fictional. However, one day she was approached by a mysterious goth man calling himself "The Guide" (Wil Wheaton ; wilwheaton.net) who told her that she was none other than Buffy Mageia, The Slayer, a legendary heroine who was destined to slay many notable vampires and demons, culminating in none other than The Master, the vampire with the oldest soul. See how she managed to do so, despite being completely non-violent, and even supportive of the demons she encountered.
